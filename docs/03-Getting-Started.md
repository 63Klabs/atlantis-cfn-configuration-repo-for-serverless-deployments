# Getting Started

There are Atlantis application starters for deploying many serverless solutions.

To assist in getting developers up and running with the CLI scripts and application starters, various tutorials have been assembled and can be viewed at [Serverless Deployments using 63K Atlantis Tutorials](https://github.com/63Klabs/atlantis-tutorials).

Once you have explored the basic application starters, proceed to other application starters which include additional features such as advanced monitoring, caching, and resource configurations.

After exploring the surface of what the CLI can do to help you manage your deployments, you can dive deep into all the features by exploring the [In-Depth Guide to Serverless Deployments using 63K Atlantis](./in-depth/10-In-Depth-Guide.md)

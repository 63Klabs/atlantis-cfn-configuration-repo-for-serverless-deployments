# Toolchain

Optional!

By default, http://63klabs.s3.amazonaws.com/projectstack-templates/atlantis/toolchain.yml is used.

HOWEVER, you can upload your own copy of the toolchain.yml file to an S3 location of your choice.

It does not need to be public, but it does need to be placed in an S3 location that can be accessed by a user who has privlages to execute AWS CLI commands against it during set up.

This copy of toolchain can always be used for your reference.

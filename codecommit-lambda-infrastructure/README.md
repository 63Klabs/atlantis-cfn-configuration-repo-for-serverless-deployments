# Serverless Application Model + CodeStar

This is a sample of the Serverless Application Model that deviates from the traditional "Hello World" example as instead it returns JSON formatted predictions.

Once the CodeStar project has been created, you may utilize local `sam` commands to develop and test locally and then push to the CodeCommit repository to initiate a deployment.

AWS CLI and SAM along with GIT will need to be set up first.

This sample application is just to seed your first CodeStar or ProjectStack deployment.

If you need a basic understanding of AWS SAM I would suggest my first tutorial [Serverless Application Model 8 Ball Example](https://github.com/chadkluck/serverless-sam-8ball-example)

If you want a more advanced application infrastructure stack with internal caching using S3 and DynamoDb and access to SSM Parameter Store for keys and secrets, check out the repository: [Serverless Webservice Template for Pipeline Atlantis](https://github.com/chadkluck/serverless-webservice-template-for-pipeline-atlantis). It is production ready code for a true CI/CD pipeline and I use it as the base of most of my API development.

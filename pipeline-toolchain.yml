# Atlantis CI/CD CodePipeline CloudFormation Template
# https://github.com/chadkluck/serverless-deploy-pipeline-atlantis
# Chad Leigh Kluck
# v2.2023-07-22 HPAD (Happy Pi Approximation Day!)
# 
# NOTE: As of v2 this toolchain no longer supports CodeStar. I just wasn't using it and including
# it complicated the set-up and learning process. The old toolchain can be found in the /deprecated
# directory for reference.
# 
# This template creates a CodePipeline triggered by commits to a CodeCommit repository to deploy 
# a simple API Gateway + Lambda web service or Event Bridge + Lambda service. It also generates
# a second CloudFormation stack in which it manages your application's infrastructure.
# 
# It creates a minimal set of IAM permissions to perform the deploy of application resources as 
# outlined under its unique CF Worker Role (which give it access to only modify its own assigned 
# infrastructure stack).
# 
# Modify this pipeline-toolchain CF template to meet your needs as you expand the number of 
# resources required by your application's infrastructure. Add permissions to the CF Worker Role 
# in order to create, modify, or delete resources in your application's infrastructure.
# 
# The CF Worker Role created and used by the Deploy Pipeline is scoped to ONLY have permission 
# to modify its own resources and Least Privilege should be maintained when defining IAM policies
# in this and subsequent templates.
# 
# (Note that there are a few IAM areas that are still under development for providing least 
# privilege. Feel free to offer code recommendations using the proper channels on the GitHub 
# repository.)
#
# Security and operational improvements will evolve and be implemented as I get the chance.
# Check the change log on the GitHub repo to keep up to date with the latest changes which you 
# may add to this template in your CloudFormation stack. If you have suggestions please submit 
# them via the proper GitHub repository channels. I check the AWS Security Hub against my stacks 
# to find areas of improvement but must prioritize.
#
# README documentation goes through installation steps. 
#
# Basically there are 6 main ideas:
# 1. Create an IAM role and policy based on the policies in iam-policy-templates (You only need to do this once for any number of pipelines)
# 2. Create a CodeCommit repository that contains this code and set up the branch you wish to deploy from. (You only need to do this once for each application or project)
# 3. Manually create a CloudFormation Deploy stack using this pipeline-toolchain.yml (README goes over filling in the parameters. There are cli-input-templates if you wish to use CLI).
# 4. Once the Deploy stack is created it will automatically grab your code from the repository branch and create the Infrastructure stack.
# 5. To deploy changes, all you need to do is commit to the monitored branch and CodePipeline will take care of the rest!
# 6. If you need to modify the way the CodePipeline performs, update this pipeline-toolchain.yml and then perform a manual stack update in CloudFormation. (Instructions in README)

#

Parameters:
  # Deployment Environment and Stage
  DeployEnvironment:
    Description: "What deploy/testing environment will this run under? This can be used for conditionals in the template. For example, PROD will use gradual deployment while DEV and TEST is AllAtOnce. Other resources, such as dashboards are created in PROD and not DEV or TEST. Suggested use: DEV for local SAM deployment, TEST for cloud deployment, PROD for stage, beta, and main/prod deployment."
    Type: String
    AllowedValues: ["DEV", "TEST", "PROD"]
    ConstraintDescription: Must specify DEV, TEST, or PROD.
    Default: "PROD"
  DeployStage:
    Description: "This project represents what stage in the CI/CD pipeline? (test, beta, stage, prod). This must match the deployment stage appended to the Project ID. The project ID plus the stage value must not exceed 15 characters. Use 'prod' for main or master branch. Ex: For ws-hello-world-prod this would be 'prod'"
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern: "[a-z0-9]*"
    MaxLength: 12
    ConstraintDescription: Must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters and be no more than 12 characters in length.
    Default: "prod" # should match default branch (or prod for main/master branch)

  # Application instance identification
  Prefix:
    Description: "Prefix to assign to resources. This can be thought of as a Name Space and will be pre-pended to all resources. Use it to identify ownership/access for teams, departments, etc. Must have a corresponding service-role. Ex: For ws-hello-world-prod this would be 'ws'."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern: "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]"
    MinLength: 3
    MaxLength: 15
    ConstraintDescription: 3 to 15 characters. Alphanumeric (upper and lower), hyphen, and underscore. Must start with a letter and must end with a letter or number.
    Default: "atlantis" 
  ProjectId:
    Description: "Do NOT include <Prefix> or <DeployStage>. This is the Project ID for the application. (Minimum 2 characters.) Ex: For ws-hello-world-dev this would be 'hello-world'"
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$"
    MinLength: 2
  ProjectStageId:
    Description: "Do NOT include <Prefix>, but DO include <ProjectId>. This is the Project ID for the application with the stage appended. Ex: For ws-hello-world-test this would be 'hello-world-test'"
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$"
    MinLength: 2
    ConstraintDescription: "Must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters, dash, or underscore, and be between 2 and 15 characters in length. (15 characters is the max recommended but not enforced.)"
  S3BucketNameOrgPrefix:
    Description: "By default, to enforce uniqueness, buckets created for deploy and infrastructure include account and region in the bucket name. However, due to S3 bucket name character limits, you can turn this off by specifying your own prefix (like an org code) that will be included before the project <Prefix> above."
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$|^$"
    ConstraintDescription: "Must start with a letter, may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens."
    Default: ""
  ParameterStoreBasePath:
    Description: "Base path in Parameter store to organize parameters for this instance. This is needed so that proper permissions may be given for the app to access Parameter Store. Must either be a single '/' or begin and end with a '/'. This value, with the Project ID appended to it, will be passed to the app build process as ParameterStoreAppPath. Parameters will be stored like this: /<ParameterStoreBasePath>/<Prefix>-<ProjectStageId>/<AppParameter>"
    Type: String
    AllowedPattern: "^\\/([a-zA-Z0-9]+([\\-][a-zA-Z0-9]+)*[\\/])+$|^\\/$"

    Default: ""
  CodeCommitBranch:

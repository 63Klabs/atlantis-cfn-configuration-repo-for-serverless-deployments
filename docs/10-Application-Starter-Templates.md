> For your first deployment using Atlantis, it is recommend you use the **00 Basic API Gateway Lambda Node.js** application starter.

Deploy the templates and applications AS-IS. After a successful deployment, you may then modify the code as needed.

Each utilize the [@63klabs/cache-data npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@63klabs/cache-data) written and maintained by the same developer of this repository. The Cache-Data package includes functions to quickly implement routing, logging, monitoring, endpoint caching, and more.

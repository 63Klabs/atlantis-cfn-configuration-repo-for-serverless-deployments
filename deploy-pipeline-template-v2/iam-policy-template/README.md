# IAM Policy Templates

Refer to [README 1 - IAM Policies](../README-1-IAM-Policies.md) for setting up required IAM Roles and Policies to be used by the Deploy Pipeline Stack.

These are IAM policy templates to attach to service roles.

Following the search/replace instructions in the IAM Policies README, you can save copies of the policies in the `/copies` directory. There is a `.gitignore` file in that directory by default so if you wish to include your copies in your personal git repository you will need to remove or modify it.

You may always go into your IAM policies in the AWS Web Console and retreive the JSON code for a policy. However, if you wish to have a back-up/reference copy, you may keep them in the `/copies` directory.

# Toolchain

This file needs to be placed in an S3 bucket that can be accessed by a user who can execute AWS CLI commands during set up.

By default, http://63klabs.s3.amazonaws.com/projectstack-templates/atlantis/toolchain.yml is used in generate.py but you upload your own copy toolchain.yml file to an S3 location of your choice.
